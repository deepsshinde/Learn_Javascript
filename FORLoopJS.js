    Lops are used to execute a piece of code again and again.
    There are many types of loops available.
    1. for loop :
          i.     //printin 
                  for(let i=1; //initialization condition
                    i<=5; //Termination COndition
                    i++  //Increment/decrement 
                   ){
                        console.log("Deeptii");
                }
         ii.     //calculate sum of 1 to 5 
                 let sum = 0;
                 for(let n=1; n<=5; n++){
                 sum +=n;
                 }
                console.log("SUm is:", sum);
