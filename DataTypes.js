Data Types are of two types

1. Primitive Data Type :
     there are 7 data types
       i. Numeric Data Type - It can be positive or can be negative.
      ii. String - 
     iii. Boolean - it has two values. true and false
      iv. Undefined - it has no value
       v. NULL - Absence of an object
      vi. BigInt - It doesnt Used widely
     vii. Symbol - It doesnt Used widely

2. Non primitives:
    i. Objects: - It is a collection of values. It stores data in Key:Value Pairs.(Deeptii : 20)
      generally we declare objects useing const keyword.
      
const student = {
    Fname: "Deeptii",
    age : 20,
    marks : 9.4,
    isPass: true,
};

We can access using object many ways:\
    typeof (student) - it will give "Object"
    student - It will print content of student in key:value pair as {Fname:Deeptii, age:20, CGPA:9.4}
    student["age"];
     

        i. Arrays
       ii. Functions
